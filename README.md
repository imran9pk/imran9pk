# Hi there, I'm Muhammad Imran! 👋

I'm a **Software Engineering Researcher and Educator** focused on improving software performance and maintainability through static analysis, machine learning, Large Language Models and empirical studies.

🎓 Currently completing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of L’Aquila, Italy, with research focused on the automation of software performance peroblems.

🌱 I'm actively writing technical articles and exploring practical tools for performance analysis and software modeling.

🤝 I enjoy collaborating on projects related to:
- Performance Bug Detection
- Static Feature Extraction for Code Modeling
- LLMs for Software Analysis
- Energy Consumption Estimation in Java Programs
